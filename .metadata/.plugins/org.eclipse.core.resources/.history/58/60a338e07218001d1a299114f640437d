/**
 *  Issue an interrupt when User button goes high (pressed and released)
 *
 *  (Page references were added for F407 Discovery Board)
 *  User & WAKE-UP Button is connected to PA0 (GPIO Port A and 0th pin) - Schematic Page 31
 *
 *  How GPIO pins interrupt the processor?
 *  (How the vendor delivers the GPIO interrupt to the processor?)
 *
 *  Go to Interrupts and events > External interrupt/event controller (EXTI) >
 *  External interrupt/event line mapping - Reference Manual Page 383
 *
 *  EXTI engine hanging on APB Bus - Reference Manual Page 381, Block Diagram - DataSheet Page 16
 *  EXTI derives the clock from PCLK2 (P CLOCK 2)
 *  EXTI finally connects to NVIC interrupt controller
 *  EXTI is giving its 23 lines to NVIC (23 different IRQ numbers)
 *  Look into Vector table to confirm 23 lines are there - Reference Manual Page 373
 *  (i.e. RTC Wakeup interrupt is not connected to NVIC directly but through EXTI Line - Reference Manual Page 373)
 *  (i.e. USB On-The-Go FS OTG_FS WKUP Wakeup through EXTI line interrupt - Reference Manual Page 375)
 *
 *  GPIO Pins Delivers their interrupt to NVIC through EXTI - Reference Manual Page 383
 *  PA0 to PI0 are connected to EXTI0 and register to look for is SYSCFG_EXTICR0
 *  PA1 to PI1 -> EXTI1 and register SYSCFG_EXTICR1
 *  ... ...
 *  PA15 to PI15 -> EXTI15 and register SYSCFG_EXTICR15
