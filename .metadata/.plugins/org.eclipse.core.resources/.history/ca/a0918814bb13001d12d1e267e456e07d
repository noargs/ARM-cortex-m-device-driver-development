/*
 * 	Switch to HSE as system clock and measure it
 *
 *	Steps: (for STM32F407 Discovery board)
 *	1. Enable the HSE clock using HSEON bit (RCC_CR)
 *	2. Wait until HSE clock from the external crystal stabilizes (only
 *	   if crystal is connected)(indicates if the high-speed external
 *	   oscillator is stable or not)
 *	3. Switch the system clock to HSE (RCC_CFGR)
 *	4. Do MCO1 settings to measure it
 *
 *	Steps: (for Nucleo board)
 *	1. Enable the HSEBYP bit (RCC_CR) (bypass the oscillator with an external clock)
 *	2. Enable the HSE clock using HSEON bit (RCC_CR)
 *	3. Switch the system clock to HSE
 *	4. Do MCO1 settings to measure it
